System requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows or Linux operating system
x86-compatible CPU with SSE2 support
OpenGL 1.1 videocard (OpenGL 2.0 is recommended)
SDL 2.0 (for Linux only, windows distribution has SDL2.dll included)


List of supported games
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supported all Unreal engine versions (1-3). The list of supported games consists of
more than 100 game titles, it is not reasonable to include it here. Some game titles
has limited support or not supported at all. Detailed information can be found here:

Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~
WARNING: it's highly recommended to read the FAQ and to watch video tutorials (see the
links above) before starting the umodel for the first time.

This is a console application, there is no GUI. Umodel is started with a set of command
line options. Easiest run is 'umodel <package_file>', it will start umodel in a viewer
mode. To see the full list of available command line options run 'umodel' with '-help'
option.

Note: if you will launch program from Windows explorer etc, you will get a console window
with a help message, but this window will immediately disappear. You could try to drag
a package file (.upk, .xxx, .ukx etc) to umodel's icon to launch the application.

The application is controlled with keyboard and mouse. You may see the full list of
keyboard shortcuts by pressing 'H' (Help) key. Here's the list of some shortcuts:

  PgUp/PgDn        browse through loaded objects
  Ctrl+S           take a screenshot into the file Screenshots/ObjectName.tga
  Alt+S            take screenshot with transparent background
  Ctrl+X           export all objects from the current scene
  Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn   scroll onscreen texts
  Shift+Up/Down    change scene FOV
  Ctrl+L           switch lighting modes
  Ctrl+Q           toggle visualization of debug information (text, 3D axis etc)
  Ctrl+G           toggle OpenGL 2.0 / OpenGL 1.1 renderer
  Esc              exit from the umodel

You may attach the AnimSet to the SkeletalMesh object using Ctrl+A key. Animation
sequences are listed by '[' and ']' keys, playback is started with a Space key.


Notes about psk/psa export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To load psk or psa into the 3ds Max you'll need ActorX Importer script created by me:
http://www.gildor.org/projects/unactorx
It has own announcements thread here:
http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,228.0.html

Some meshes contains information which cannot fit into psk standard. For this reason I've
extended the format to hold advanced information. Files in this format has extension pskx
and cannot be loaded into UnrealEd or any other application with ActorX support. There's
only one tool with pskx support at the moment - ActorX Importer mentioned above.


Notes about md5mesh/md5anim export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Umodel has possibility to export skeletal meshes and animations in idSoftware md5 format.
To use this exporter you should use command line option "-md5". MeshAnimation and AnimSet
objects are exported as multiple md5anim files (one file for each animation track). "bounds"
section in md5anim is filled with dummy data. "hierarchy" section also does not contain real
skeleton hierarchy because Unreal engine uses hierarchy from the mesh, not from the
animation. Some md5 viewers/importers does require md5anim hierarchy, some - does not.

There is a 3ds Max md5mesh/md5anim importer script available on umodel forum:
http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php?topic=87.0
or here
http://www.gildor.org/downloads
This script was originally created by der_ton, but was updated by me.

Please note that psk/psa format is more powerful, and ActorX Importer script has much more
capabilities than md5 Importer.


Notes about StaticMesh support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
StaticMesh export is performed into psk format. This format was originally designed to hold
SkeletalMesh, but umodel uses it for StaticMesh too. Exported mesh will not have a skeleton
and vertex influences. Resulting psk files cannot be imported directly into the UnrealEd,
so I've decided to save ot with pskx extension to avoid silly user errors. Such mesh could
be imported into 3ds Max using ActorX Importer plugin as well as ordinary psk file.


Notes about material export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Materials are exported in a custom format. File extension is ".mat". At the current moment,
this format is supported by ActorX Importer plugin only. Unreal engine materials are very
complex, so it's very hard to separate a few channels (diffuse, specular, bump etc) from it.
Umodel tries to accomplish this with use of some heuristics - sometimes with good results,
sometimes with bad. Umodel will never export full materials (GLSL script etc). Do not expect
too much from this feature.
